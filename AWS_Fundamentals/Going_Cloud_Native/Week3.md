### Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)  
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it straightforward to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as provisioning hardware, setting up the database, patching, and making backups.

Amazon RDS currently supports six database engines:

Amazon Aurora: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/  
PostgreSQL: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/  
MySQL: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/  
MariaDB: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mariadb/  
Oracle: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/  
Microsoft SQL Server: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/  
You can use the AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) (https://aws.amazon.com/dms) to quickly and securely migrate your databases to AWS.

Amazon RDS is eligible for the AWS Free Tier. More details on pricing for Amazon RDS are available here: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/pricing/
